Today is a great day! It is the first of our mission into Otherworld, and the
start of a new dawn. It's been a long journey, and I can't wait to see what
this world has in store for us. We emerged from the portal into a lush forest,
and I was struck with the beauty of this place. The portal indicated that many
of the conditions here were very similar to that of Homeworld, but I didn't
realize that it would look so similar to home.

Everything was the same. I recognize all sorts of species from home, like the
pine trees and the squirrels, and the shades of moss on the rocks. It was
uncanny. And everything was larger, or we had shrunk, I'm still not entirely
sure. It's as if I am in a dream, conjured up by my imagination. But it feels
too real to be a dream. It's a strange feeling, for sure.

Once we got over ourselves we dismantled and hid the portal frame to keep it
away from wildlife and things. Well, it was more like Danera dismantled the
portal and refused to let any of us help. She's always been like this; It makes
her a very capable person. After that, we set out to find shelter and run
preliminary experiments. We found a good place to stay for the night before we
set out tomorrow to look for a more permanent base to run our experiments.

Our first mission into Otherworld has commenced! We're making history for the
benefit of all. I'll surely be promoted in the organization for this. I mean,
we aren't even twenty four hours into our mission and we've discovered so much
that could help people. How couldn't they give us some recognition?

When the people reading the sensors said this place had basically the same
climate as home, they weren't lying; Everything looked so similar! There was a
sun, and green plants, and blue skies (although they seemed a little bit too
blue to me, if that's any consolation). It was all so HUGE, and everything
seemed more lively. I have so many ideas for huge tree houses and farming
techniques and stuff already. This'll be a breeze.

We left the portal to go find shelter for the night, and saw more weird stuff.
There were these paths, like hiking paths at home, and they were super wide,
because of course. That means that there might be some kind of intelligent
civilization living here. I wonder what we'll call them? Beings? People?
Something like that. Nepis told us to keep away from the path, in case we
encounter any being-people. She's totally overreacting though.

Well, this is going to be a doozy. We arrived in Otherworld and started our
three week long journey into this strange place. It is nearly identical to
Homeworld, much to the group's surprise. This will prove both an asset and a
hindrance to our future activities here.

The first thing we did was we left to look for shelter for the night. We found
a rock outcropping and set up a small camp. It was relatively easy because of
our familiarity with the conditions, although we must be careful not to let our
guard down. The next thing for us to do is to find a better location to set up
our larger pieces of equipment.

We collected some sensor data while we rested, and the results confirm our
findings. The climate is nearly identical to homeworld, to within regional
variation. The soil samples we analyzed show that the ground is rich with
nutrients, which might explain the fact that life seems to thrive here. I will
make some more definite conclusions when I get a larger wealth of data.

At long last, our 6 months of planning and training has led up to this. I can't
believe I'm even here. I mean, if you had told me a year ago that I was going
to be one of the first in another world exploring and advancing civilization,
well, I'd probably call the loony bin before you finished talking.

It was different than I thought it would be. The forest was so lush, extending
as far as the eye could see and an orchestra of noise engulfing you. It felt
eerily like home. Like, too much like home. I mean, our two worlds have never
had any contact before, so how is everything so similar? I'm sure we'll find
out soon.

During dinner, the ladies talked about science stuff I didn't really
understand. It feels weird being the only regular person among three
scientists. Whenever I say something it ends up being stupid and then it gets
awkward. Anyway, the day was good; I can feel the excitement for all the stuff
to come.

Today we encountered the edge of the forest and witnessed something entirely
awesome. There is indeed intelligent life here, and it's leagues ahead of us
technologically. We saw a vast area of structures, larger than any of our
cities, and wheeled machines roaring across stone paths. The life looks just
like us, a turn that surprised none of us, but is strange nonetheless.

The repercussions of this discovery will paint the rest of this mission in a
new light. We'll essentially have to be hiding for the rest of the mission, and
we have a whole lot more work to do. We have to find a base, and fast.
Somewhere we can learn more about this life while staying relatively hidden.
This is the discovery of a century! We cannot allow ourselves to mess this up.

On a lighter note, there have been a few pleasant discoveries here. Something
we never could have expected is that when the sun goes down, there are little
points in the sky that appear, maybe a hundred or more. They're pretty, but we
have no idea why they're there. The weirdest thing is that they aren't held in
place by anything, yet they don't move. This world!

                                      M004

On our fourth consecutive day searching for a site, we FINALLY found something
(It is a nice place, but it wasn't worth it to wait this long). The one
interesting thing about it is that there's these two enormous structures that
contain Others! (We're calling them Others cause they're from Otherworld).

We arrived there in the afternoon, and started to set up camp a little bit away
from the structures, and we saw a few Others come out and scatter, then more,
and more and more, until there were others everywhere! Some went up to the area
with the machines, some went IN the machines which then left (maybe some kind
of transport for them???), and some went to the secondary structure. They were
all different sizes, with some as small as us, and some, like, twice our height.

We're gonna go on a trip tomorrow night to see what we can discover here, but
for now we need to secure the base and set up all the cool instruments. I can't
wait to see what the Others have in store for us! Too bad we can't talk to them.

                                      D005

After setting up the camp, we are now ready to do some real science.
Unfortunately, Nepis wanted me to go with her to explore the main structure,
while the others start distributing sensors. At least we discovered some
interesting things to think about. This world's mystery may yet be unraveled.

While the sun set, we walked around the property to get an overview before we
went in. It seems the outside is divided into several parts. On one side is an
unused section of forest with a path that encircles it. On another is a
collection of odd areas, perhaps for games, although what games I do not know.
There is the secondary structure, which we stayed away from to avoid being
seen, and a large flat area where the transport machines come.

Then of course there is the main structure. It contains many rooms around a
central open area, of course so large that it could easily contain several
houses. Most rooms were very similar, although they ranged in complexity. Each
one had ample seating and a large board for drawing, as well as a desk, and
things on the walls. Some had things so basic they looked like they were for
educating toddlers, but there were also things in other rooms we had only just
discovered, like calculus and atoms, and some things we had never seen before.
It seems that this place is a school for educating young Others to become great
scientists.

                                      N007

Yesterday we attempted to get into the secondary structure, but unlike the
school, where we were able to open the doors by force, the doors here were
thoroughly locked. We know that the others can get into the structures, so
today we watched them to figure out how they get in.

During the day, the Others can open the doors no problem, as if the doors
unlocked themselves, on some electrical timer or something. Sometimes, the
doors become locked again, and to get in they press a card of some kind up
against a black pad next to the door and then they can open it. That means that
in order to get in we would need to get one of those cards. Well, unless
there's another way, I guess we'll simply never find out what's in the
secondary structure.

I miss home. It's only been a week and yet it feels like a month. How am I
going to survive if I have to spend months, even years here without ever seeing
my family? Maybe the portal technology will improve and I'll get to spend the
weekends at home or something. What if I die here? Oh, I'm sure it will be fine.

                                      A011

Man, I hate this group sometimes. Today the ladies were discussing the outcomes
of some recent experiments and I made it clear that I wanted to join and
discuss it with them. I even understood what some of the tests were, but they
assumed that I didn't and suggested that I do some stupid errands instead. Just
because I'm not a fancy scientist doesn't mean that I can't be a part of the
conversation!

Well, jokes on them, cause I have something they don't. Jokes! Ha! Listen to
this. A priest, a rabbi, and an atheist walk into a bar; The barman says, "What
is this, some kind of joke?". I've got another one. This one's good. Three
genius, hardworking, stuck up scientists and a stupid dumb comedian are sent on
a mission to advance civilization; The three scientists say, "What is this,
some kind of joke?", and the comedian is extremely hurt, wondering why he was
even selected in the first place if he's so stupid and dumb.

Maybe I should just talk to them. It's not that I'm dumb, I'm just
misunderstood. I want to help. I'm gonna to talk to Danera now. She'll know how
to handle this.

PS. I talked to Danera and she reassured me. She read the notes from earlier
and explained everything to me. I still don't understand all the way, but I
think I've got a grasp on what's actually happening. I even said something she
hadn't considered, so I AM useful.

Lately I've started experiencing this uneasiness in my stomach, like I'm
rotting on the inside, and I can't escape. It comes when I'm doing the laundry,
or as I lay at night. I think I'm lonely. Come to think of it, I've never
really gone this long without my family before. I thought that the others would
keep me company, but I don't really talk to them outside of the mission. What
am I gonna do?

The mission has really slowed down. We just have a few experiments left and
what we have is data collection to be analyzed at home. Mina and Adal spend
most of their time watching the Other structures, and Danera does all of the
technical work. I was expecting to have tons of new species to examine, but
none of them are particularly notable beyond being abnormally large. I feel
left behind.

There was so much more wonder in the air at the start. We had such high
expectations; This world would never fail to surprise us, surely! But how can
we be in wonder if everything is so similar? I feel so troubled now. I can't
wait for this all to be over. Well, at least it's just another week. Perhaps I
can manage until we get back home.

                                      D020

Today we packed up the camp in preparation for our journey back tomorrow. I
thought I would take some time to reflect on our journey here. It was so
different from what I expected, and yet so familiar. I am no closer to
deciphering the mysteries of this world, but I am sure that there will be
future missions for that. My task now is to go home and process all this data
and begin to make the world a better place.

We have made so much progress here in the last few weeks, and I think I often
lose sight of that. It feels like I am doing work everyday and trying my
hardest, yet making no progress on the larger problems. I always need to remind
myself that large problems are large because you cannot make much progress on
them in a short time. This is surely one of the most exciting parts of future
history, and we do not appreciate it because we are swept up in the moment.

We have a lot of work ahead of us, and I just hope we do not mess it up. Things
are looking up, for now. It will be nice to get back home, back to all my
instruments and my house. When I get home, I will go right into work again, so
I can write up my report as soon as possible. I can sleep when I am dead.
