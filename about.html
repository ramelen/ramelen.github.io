            I don't quite know how to describe myself. I've always thought of myself as a very weird
            person, but the more I learn about people, the ordinary I realise I am. I'm certainly
            not the poster child of mundane, per say, but I wouldn't say I'm anything extrordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's the superficial description of me; I was born in Calgary and native to the
            Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada; I've got a trans brother and my paternal
            grandmother is a Korean immigrant; I've never traveled much, but I spent much of my
            teenage years at a very international school.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there's the cover letter description of me; I'm in high school, looking to do a BSc
            of Computer Science at UBCO; I'm intellectually gifted and seeking an ADHD diagnosis (My
            brother and father have it as well); I'm great at critical thinking and picking things
            up quickly, and I always get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've got a creative side too; I love math and programming and languages; I've written
            10000 words for a multi-year scavenger hunt; I've designed an entire (small) language
            with plans for another; I've got a personal website that I use to show off all my stuff,
            and plans to start developing for AR.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course, I've got my insecurities; I'm very stubborn and sometimes inconsiderate
            of other people; I haven't got much of a social life; I'm underweight and dehydrated a
            lot of the time (I'm working on this!), and I don't excersise; I'm not very observant,
            and will often get stuck in my own head thinking about whatever crosses my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I think the way I ought to describe myself is this: I'm just like everyone else;
            figuring it out. That's why I call myself Ramelen. My life's just one big ramble,
            enjoying the sights as I go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and if you just wanted to see if I'm excited about the things you're excited about,
            the rest of this page is just a list of all the things I like, roughly in order of how
            much I'm excited about them.
