            Challenges and Opportunities in Planned Sustainable city design
        </h1>
        <p>
            A common statistic is that by 2050, over two-thirds of the population will live in
            cities (Statistica). It is clear that moving forward in the climate crisis, sustainable
            city design will make or break our efforts to limit warming to 1.5ºC. There are
            currently two main approaches to sustainable city design: retrofitted cities, and
            planned cities. Retrofitting a city entails implementing new systems into an existing
            city to align it with the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Planned cities
            have been designed by a government or corporation to exemplify the SDGs right from the
            start. This essay will outline some of the challenges and opportunities in planned city
            design in comparison to retrofitting and conclude that in general, the riskiness of
            planned cities makes retrofitting the preferable method.

            One of the largest issues with building a city from scratch is how expensive it is, with
            some planned cities in the 100s of billions of dollars. The corporation Neom is building
            a city named “The Line” in Saudi Arabia, named so because it is only 200 meters wide,
            but over 170 km long and 500 meters tall. It has started construction at USD 100 billion
            to USD 500 billion, with a population of around 9 million (El Yaakoubi and Rashad). In
            contrast, retrofitting London (also a city of 9 million) by 2050 is estimated by some to
            cost around USD 3 trillion (O'Driscoll). Both

            carbon-neutral emissions when their projects are completed, but the cost of London’s
            retrofitting will cost over six times more. The price difference is likely because
            designing systems from scratch is much more cost-efficient when you do not need to run
            them continuously, like a rail network or power grid. The Line will also be able to use
            cheaper methods that are not viable in London, such as vertical architecture and
            roadless transportation (El Yaakoubi and Rashad).
        </p>

            One issue that has plagued many planned cities is that construction has so much
            difficulty or the city does not function very well; the population stays low forever,
            and it becomes a ghost town. This is what happened to Songdo, South Korea, a planned
            city that is fully operational, with vast green spaces and towering skyscrapers, yet
            citizens and visitors alike often report that the city feels empty and have trouble
            finding people to socialize with. One resident says “There’s a ton of people living
            here, but you don’t really see them. The city is alive, but it’s invisible” (Poon). The
            problem with building a city in a short time frame of a decade or two is the risk of
            ending up with a dysfunctional city before working out the flaws in its design. This is
            not a problem in cities that evolve naturally, because if a system doesn’t suit its
            citizens at any point, the city doesn’t grow further and doesn’t warrant large spending
            to retrofit it. Many planned cities become successful, like Adelaide, Australia, or
            Washington, DC, USA, but natural cities are always successful at that size. Planning and
            building a city is a huge risk to take for such a large cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the advantages that conventional cities have is that during the retrofitting
            process, it is harder to become less sustainable. Indonesia’s new planned capital,
            Nusantara, is set to be opened in 2024, with 250,000 residents, slowly expanding to a
            max of 1.91 million (Antara News). It advertises itself as a sustainable modern city,
            but people are worried that the construction of Nusantara will emit large amounts of
            carbon and disrupt the surrounding Borneo ecology, possibly for a radius of 30
            kilometers from the city center (Lechner). There likely aren't very many optimal places
            for a smart city anymore, because those places have already been built upon and now
            there are conventional cities there, leaving primarily large swaths of desert or
            ecologically important areas to build on, causing damage to the surrounding environment.
            Retrofitting cities on the other hand don’t need to expand into new space, but instead
            spend money developing the environment around them to promote sustainability. Buenos
            Aires, Argentina has developed the infrastructure around Lake Soldati to reduce flood
            risk and increase water quality for its poorer residents (Locomotive Works).
        </p>
        <p>
            While planned cities are more cost-efficient and faster to build, they are much riskier
            and possibly harmful to the environment. That is to say, there are well-executed planned
            cities, but the ones that are not well-executed are such a huge waste that it is not
            worth it to construct cities mainly this way. In my opinion, retrofitting is the
            preferable solution in many cases, and a much safer use of money.
