            (This is a recontextualization of a play scene in the 1960s (ish) play "Rhinoceros" in
            the style of a sitcom, "The Office US".)</p>
        <pre>

                                MICHAEL
                [Emerges from Office] Okay, People! Gather
                around. It's time for “Sharing Corner”.
                That’s right, c’mon.

The camera pans around anxiously. People enter the meeting
room and sit down.

            	                MICHAEL
                [Meeting Room] I'm instituting a new
                policy. Every wednesday at 2:00 we enter
                this meeting room and share interesting
                things that happened this week. Jim, you
                start.

            	                MICHAEL
                [Interview] There just hasn't been enough
                cheer around here y’know? When I walk into
                work I wanna see smiling faces [shot of
                employees scowling while doing work] and
                chatter all around. It’s like they always
                say: “friendship is the real magic”. Huh?

            	                KEVIN
                [Meeting Room] Yesterday I ate 5 chili dogs
                in one sitting. Nothing prepares you for
                what comes after, but it was worth it.

            	                MICHAEL
                Ew. Okay, Pam, You go next.

            	                PAM
                Well, It sounds odd when I say it out loud,
                but I think I saw a rhinoceros on main
                street the other day.

People around the table are shocked.

            	                DWIGHT
                What? No way. Pam is lying -- there haven't
                been any rhinoceroses in Scranton for
                decades.

            	                JIM
                Wait. I think I read something about this
                in the paper. Pam, you were really there?

            	                PAM
                Well, yeah, I -

            	                DWIGHT
                Stop right there. Lemme see that article.
                Jim walks over to his desk and picks up a
                newspaper.

            	                JIM
                It's right here, see for yourself.

            	                DWIGHT
                [with an air of the greatest scorn] pfff!

            	                JIM
                It's all here; it's down here in the
                column! read it for yourself, Michael.

            	                MICHAEL
                'Yesterday, just before lunch time,in the
                church square of our town, a cat was
                trampled to death by an escaped pachyderm.'

            	                PAM
                It wasn't exactly in the church square.

            	            MICHAEL
                That's all it says. no other details. What
                kind of a newspaper is this?

            	                DWIGHT
                I never believe journalists. they're all
                liars. I don't need them to tell me what to
                think; I believe what I see with my own
                eyes. Speaking as a Scranton Police
                Volunteer Officer, I like things to be
                precise, scientifically valid; I've got a
                methodical mind.

            	                JIM
                [Interview] Dwight has this insane hatred
                towards the news. One time, he went to the
                zoo in order to prove that they didnt have
                a primate exhibit. Luckily we diffused the
                situation, but uh, It was a close call.

            	                DWIGHT
                [Meeting Room] You call that precise? and
                what, pray, does it mean by a pachyderm?
                What does the editor of a dead cats column
                understand by a pachyderm? he doesn't say.
                And what does he mean by a cat?

            	                JIM
                I mean, who doesn’t know what a cat is?

            	                DWIGHT
                Does it concern me? Is a male or a female?
                What colour was it? and what breed? The
                breed of the cat is of extreme importance.

            	                MICHAEL
                What has the color to do with it? It's
                quite beside the point.

            	                DWIGHT
                Michael, the breed problem is one of the
                great stumbling blocks of our time. It's
                not an issue to be dismissed lightly.
                Several medical studies have shown that
                stray cats are more agressive than tabbies.

            	                JIM
                I tell you it doesn't enter into it. it's
                simply a question of a cat being run over
                by a pachyderm -- in this case, a
                rhinoceros.

            	                DWIGHT
                While it may seem that I am a distinguised
                city person, I am a farmer through and
                through, and on the Shrute Family Farm, we
                were raised with sensible reasoning
                abilities. City goers have got too much
                imagination. Perhaps it was merely a flea
                run over by a mouse. people make mountains
                out of molehills.

            	                MICHAEL
                [to PAM] let us try and get things clear.
                Did you yourself, with your own eyes, see
                a rhinoceros strolling through the streets
                of the town?

            	                PAM
                It didn't stroll, it ran.

            	                DWIGHT
                [interrupting her] Come on. it's obvious
                they were just making it up. you put too
                much trust in these journalists; they
                don't care what they invent to sell their
                wretched newspapers and please the bosses
                they serve!

            	                PAM
                But I saw it, I saw the rhinoceros. I'd
                take my oath on it. And I wasnt the only
                one watching. There was a huge crowd!

                                DWIGHT
                Pfff! they were probably watching
                something else! a few idlers with nothing
                to do, work-shy loafers!

                                JIM
                Didnt it happen on a sunday?

                                DWIGHT
                I work on Sundays as well. I've no time
                for priests who do their utmost to get
                you to church, just to prevent you from
                working, and canning your daily bread
                by the sweat of your brow.

Michael looks around nervously and finally speaks.

                                MICHAEL
                Well! I think that Sharing corner has
                been a success, now let’s get back to
                work. Uh, because we have lots of work
                to do, yep!

People grumble and shuffle out of the room.
