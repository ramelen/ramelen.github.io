            The Connection between Climate Change and Conflict in Yemen<
        </h1>
        <p>
            Yemen is a small coastal country located south of Saudi Arabia, with a population
            similar to Canada; 32 million (Worldometer). It is both the poorest country in the
            middle east, and the most affected by climate change, being named by the UN as the
            world's worst humanitarian disaster (HRP Yemen, 11). The effects of climate change and
            conflict in Yemen is an extremely complex issue with factors interacting and feeding
            into each other. Among other things, there is an ongoing civil war that has directly
            claimed over 100,000 lives (11), widespread famine for 16 million people (BBC News), a
            cholera outbreak (HRP Yemen, 13), and the worst water crisis in the Middle East (USAID,
            1). It is undeniable that climate change worsens conflict in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2015, a civil war erupted when Houthi rebels took control of the government and
            overthrew the president, prompting a Saudi Arabian coalition to attempt to restore the
            original government (New York Times). The rebels took over when Yemen had to cut fuel
            subsidies as a condition for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (Muftah). The
            removal of these subsidies was poorly executed and raised transportation, food and water
            prices. Yemen was receivinggetting this loan to support the economy, which had been
            damaged from previous civil wars (1962 and 1994). Now, as the current civil war stands
            at a stalemate, over 80% of the population is under the poverty line (HRP Yemen, 12),
            and the economy isn't getting any better.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a consequence of the war, blockades have reduced the amount of food coming into Yemen
            (Gebrekidan and Saul). This is a huge problem because only a small amount of Yemen's
            agricultural output is food (USAID, 3), and they rely mostly on imports. Additionally,
            over half of the population is employed in agriculture (3), and farms are being
            destroyed by typhoons and killed by droughts. Floods in 2008 displaced 20,000 people and
            caused about 1.6 billion US dollars in damage, nearly 6% of Yemen’s GDP (Al Harazi).
            This is not only contributing to the famine, but worsening poverty as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest concern for Yemen however is water scarcity, as large cities use up their
            water supply much faster than is sustainable (USAID, 3). Sana’a, the capital city is
            projected to run out of water in 2040 or earlier (Lackner and Al-Eryani), and Taiz, the
            second largest city in Yemen, is currently dependent on humanitarian aid as many wells
            there have dried up, although it still isn’t enough (Galib and Al-Awjari). Additionally,
            unsafe drinking water has led to a cholera epidemic, with millions of cases. Water
            scarcity is the most far reaching and urgent problem in Yemen, and without more
            humanitarian aid, Yemen will continue to decline.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these factors are leading to worsening conflict, both in and out of the civil
            war. Around 4 million people have been displaced since 2015 (HRP Yemen, 5), from a
            combination of flooding and war, which is placing a huge strain on cities to provide for
            so many more people. Marib, a governorate that had around 500,000 population in 2014 now
            exceeds 3 million people because of internal displacement (Jafarnia). Fights have broken
            out over land, sewage and waste management, and the story is much the same all over
            Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water scarcity is also a large source of conflict outside of the war. The two villages
            of Quradah and Al-Marzooh are currently in conflict over a spring, and violence has been
            taking place since 1997. The people of Al-Marzooh were afraid that new development in
            Quradah would take away from their water supply, so they sabotaged the infrastructure in
            Al-Marzooh to protect themselves. Government officials have tried to intervene multiple
            times, but the locals resisted and caused further damage. The fighting is theoretically
            resolved as the two villages now each get a set portion of the water, but conflict
            remains and the water is still scarce (Adelphi).
        </p>
        <p>
            While things are looking very dire for Yemen, there are hopes that humanitarian aid will
            be able to help the 21 million people that require it, although at a hefty cost. The UN
            is proposing a 3.85 billion dollar plan to provide aid to nearly 16 million people. The
            three objectives are 1) to prevent disease outbreaks and reduce mortality ($1.02
            billion), 2) to prevent famine and restore livelihoods ($2.26 billion), and 3) to
            protect and assist civilians ($576.9 million) (HRP Yemen, 5). The main challenges faced
            are difficulties in getting to areas where help is needed, as many of these areas are
            war torn and are not very accessible. Much effort may go to waste if aid is intercepted
            before it reaches its destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the civil war is doing the majority of the damage, effects from climate change are
            greatly increasing suffering and feeding into other issues that are pushing Yemen over
            its tipping point. Flooding and tropical storms are causing massive displacement, while
            drought withers crops and creates food scarcity. Over half of Yemen is in need of
            humanitarian aid, but if the world acts quickly, it may be possible to avoid
            catastrophic failure.
