            The Fur Trade
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Fur Trade is a system of trading where first nations would hunt mammals like beavers
            for their pelts, and they would trade the fur to Europeans for things like guns, horses,
            and tools. The Europeans would then ship the pelts to Europe to be turned into hats and
            robes as a status symbol of high society. Most of this took place in Eastern Canada (The
            West coast did get some love, though not till later.) from the 16th century to the late
            19th century. The fur trade is still happening today, just not as strong as during the
            colonization of North America. Speaking of colonization of North America, The whole
            event changed so many lives and the world views of people across continents. The
            Europeans had been living in Eurasia for hundreds of thousands of years, so they had
            developed much larger populations and societal ideals than the First Nations because
            they had only been developing their technology and economy for a mere ten thousand
            years. They still believed in animism, and people were still living in small tribes
            where everybody knew each other - compared to the bustling cities and complex
            competitive markets of Britain and France.

            One of the largest changes in First Nations lives was the shift in economy and world
            view from a world created to share and live in harmony to a much more capitalistic
            landscape. Because Europe always needed more pelts, the first nations could focus just
            on animals like beavers to provide a huge income of supplies and tools, than they had
            before. This disrupted the ‘use the entire animal’ philosophy of the previous
            generations and was dropped in favor of high profit margins and huge payouts. They were
            spending so much time hunting for fur that they didn’t have very much time to hunt for
            food. They created borders and increased the amount of conflict between tribes over
            border disputes, even though never would have before.

            As with many economic revolutions, There were more people, and they had more stuff, but
            they had a whole new set of problems bundled along with that. In certain areas, it
            wasn’t the Europeans that were drainting the land of beavers, but the first nations were
            doing more damage to the environment. It wasn’t all them though, some of this trading
            involved products from Europe that killed thousands of First Nations people. It was
            Europe that introduced alcohol to the trading ports, and that caused rampant alcoholism
            all over North america. The Europeans also had extremely deadly diseases that they were
            carrying around, and that ended up killing 90%, or 50 million of the first nations
            population. As with many economic revolutions, the long term consequences were much
            worse than the short term benefits.

            So, to round things up - the short term consequences of the fur trade were good. The
            first nations were wealthier than ever before, and business was booming in Europe too,
            but the good times wouldn’t last. The Europeans thought it would be a good idea to get
            the first nations hooked on alcohol, like they did with China and opioids. They also
            decided that because the first nations were clearly inferior and almost animals, they
            started killing them using plague blankets mixed in with normal ones for trading. They
            ended up killing most of the first nations, and they put the survivors in residential
            schools. They also brought the idea of capitalism and made the first nation less
            respectful of their own tradition. So the main effect for the first nation people is
            that they lost 90% of their population plus permanent societal dysfunction and the
            Europeans got fancy hats.
