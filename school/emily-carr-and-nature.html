            How Emily Carr was Influenced by Nature
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this essay, I will be looking at the aspects of Emily Carr’s life and evaluating how she was influenced towards nature in her art. I will also look at a painting of hers and imagine what it might look like if she was born in the 21st century where nature plays a different role. Nature played many different roles in her life, and I will go over them one by one.

            First of all, who is Emily Carr, and what is influence? This sounds basic, but is necessary to answer the question. Emily Carr was a post impressionist painter who made various artworks of the indininous people of british columbia, and later in her career, landscape paintings. She is named by the Canadian encyclopedia as a Canadian icon.

            Influence is the power to change the outcome of an event, to make someone vote for you, or to make someone crash into a tree because they had one too many martinis that night. In this case, it would be in the influence of nature on her paintings. If nature had played a very different part in her life, how would that change her paintings?

            Emily Carr had a natural affinity towards nature. She loved to play with animals and spent a lot of time outside, and would even find stray animals and take them into her home for a short time.. She preferred climbing trees to the more ladylike activities for the time and was always running off into the woods where she could play and feel at home. This was partially because she was born in the 1870s, where her home, Victoria had just appeared because of the gold rush. There was little to no urbanization, and so she would have had constant exposure to nature in its fullest. She was living in the wild Canadian west.

            By the time Emily Carr was 17, both of her parents had died. This had caused her to disassociate herself with the english tradition that her parents had raised her in. She then went to the indigenous culture to fill her gap in identity. This had pulled her even closer towards nature, as the culture of the first nations was very focused in that area.

            She also believed that there was a divine purpose in nature, so she followed her own spirituality, which propelled her to paint landscapes and culture before it was gone and people had forgotten about it. She wrote:
        </p>
        <p>
            These things should be to us Canadians what the ancient Briton's relics are to the English. Only a few more years and they will be gone forever into silent nothingness and I would gather my collection together before they are forever past.
        </p>

            She felt an obligation to preserve the Canadian tradition, her entire purpose to paint was because she felt she had a duty to protect nature. Emily Carr became influenced by Theosophic thought, like many artists of the time, and began to form a new vision of God as nature. She led a spiritual way of life, rejecting the Church and the religious institution. She began to paint raw landscapes found in the Canadian wilderness, mystically animated by a greater spirit.

            Later in her life, she was drawn into the world of landscape paintings. She felt that by painting the aborigional culture, she was not expressing her feelings, just copying off of the first nations. She felt more free and more peaceful during this period, and spent the rest of her life doing landscape painting.

            I will look at one of her paintings, and see how she was influenced by nature, and how that changed the outcome of the painting. The painting that I’ll be looking at is called Reforestation. As you can see, it is a landscape painting of the mountains and a forest. My first impressions of this painting are that it is very flowy and not very detailed, as is indicative of the post impressionistic era. The main theme of the artwork is around nature. In fact, all of Emily Carr's artworks are themed around nature. All except her self portrait. There are many lines that led you around the page.

            I think that if Emily Carr and been born in the 21 century, and this was being painted in 2025, that there would still be nature, but much less of it, because there isn’t as much nature now rather than then, if she had still sought out the culture of canada, she would have stumbled across very different issues and maybe her art would have taken a more somber tone, given the atrocities that happened to the first nations of canada.

            Her painting might have shown skyscrapers in place of the mountains, or cars instead of trees, and some of her works might have shown the effects of climate change and how that affects the welfare of the people. She might also take a different path, instead showing modern reservations, or populated areas. She might choose to preserve other aspects of society that are disappearing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, we come back to the driving question, to what extent was Emily Carr influenced by nature. Given how she looked for refuge in nature, and found a community in the first nations, to her worldview. I would say that she was more than just influenced by nature, It played a monumental role in her life, and touched every part of it. Nature was almost her entire reason for being. If Emily Carr had never grown up with nature, she would be unrecognizable. Sometimes, our entire lives are defined by this one thing, so before you go, ask yourself that question, and realize what defines you, so that you can take control of your life.
