            An Overview of Gamma Ray Sterilization
        </h1>
        <p>
            With the need for sterilization ever increasing with the pandemic and the rise in
            variety in techniques, it is important to consider each of their use cases and
            appreciate their differences. This essay will outline some advantages and disadvantages
            of gamma ray sterilization, as well as how the process works.
        </p>
        <p>
            The technology that I’ll discuss today is that of sterilization by gamma irradiation.
            This is differentiated from E beam and X ray irradiation, which also have their own use
            cases among the many types of sterilization. In the process of gamma ray sterilization,
            objects are exposed to cobalt-60, a source of gamma radiation (I.Enviroguard). The
            ionizing gamma rays will knock electrons from their atoms and in doing so, make them
            extremely reactive. These irradiated particles can bind with the compounds in DNA, which
            are very vulnerable to this kind of reactive particle (Goronzy). The failure of an
            organism to repair its DNA will most likely result in its death, sterilizing the
            material. Notably, the reactive particles are not as disruptive to most other materials
            like glass or metal, meaning that it is viable in certain situations and radiation doses
            to use this as a sterilization technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cobalt-60 used to produce gamma rays is almost always manufactured by bombarding it
            with neutrons from a nuclear reactor. A slug of cobalt-59, the stable isotope of cobalt,
            is lowered into an active nuclear reactor, where the cobalt absorbs neutrons coming from
            the reactor, becoming cobalt-60 (Finkiel). This cobalt acts similarly to cobalt-59, but
            its extra neutron means that it is unstable. To rid itself of the extra energy, the
            cobalt will emit an electromagnetic wave in the form of a gamma ray. Gamma rays are the
            highest energy form of electromagnetic wave, and very penetrating as well, which is why
            they are used here instead of other forms of radiation. Alpha and beta radiation, while
            more ionizing, aren't penetrating enough to be used in as wide a range of materials as
            gamma radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
            A huge advantage that gamma ray sterilization has over traditional techniques is that it
            works on a wide range of materials. Gamma rays can penetrate materials of any size,
            density, phase, or temperature, and affect many nonliving materials minimally (Goronzy).
            This means that it can be used for medical devices that are already in the packaging,
            and so is used to sterilize over 40% of the world’s disposable medical supplies such as
            syringes and surgical gloves. Pharmaceuticals and other temperature sensitive products
            can be sterilized as gamma radiation negligibly affects the temperature unlike heat
            based sterilization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another advantage of gamma radiation is that only a single variable, the dose and
            application time needs to be monitored, while all others are constant. This makes gamma
            ray sterilization simple and easy to control compared to other methods of sterilization.
            For example, Ethylene oxide sterilization is a gas based technique where an object is
            surrounded by an ethylene oxide solution to kill bacteria. This process however requires
            5 stages to be performed, each of which has many variables to control and can take over
            12 hours to complete (CDC). This is because ethylene oxide is toxic to humans and will
            stay in the object afterward, requiring aeration to remove it. Another advantage that
            gamma ray sterilization has over gas based sterilization is that the former can be done
            continuously as the flow of harmful radiation can be controlled, but airtight chambers
            must be in place for gas to be contained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest drawback to gamma ray sterilization is the cost to set up the whole process
            in the first place. First cobalt must be collected, often from unethical sources, as 65%
            of the world’s cobalt supply originates from byproducts of silver and copper harvested
            from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where child labour and other unethical practices
            are rampant need an in-text citation to acknowledge the source of this statement. Then
            the cobalt must be treated in a nuclear reactor, of which only a few hundred in the
            world produce cobalt-60. This cobalt must be carefully regulated to avoid irradiation of
            the people handling it, while it is transported all over the world. After the cobalt has
            been expended to the point where it is not useful anymore, it is still radioactive and
            needs to be disposed of safely. It is important to point out that while this process is
            costly, it is mostly safe, so in some situations it is worth the cost.

            While the risks and costs of using gamma radiation based sterilization restricts gamma
            ray sterilization from becoming a universal technique, the virtues of the technology
            make it the preferred technique in many areas. When sterilizing variable density items,
            processing large volumes of material continuously, needing to process items already in
            packaging to reduce chance of recontamination, or objects with areas that are hard to
            reach with gas, gamma radiation is a great method. When working on a budget without
            specialized equipment, or working with materials that are sensitive to breakdown from
            gamma radiation like some plastics, heat or gas based sterilization techniques are the
            way to go.
