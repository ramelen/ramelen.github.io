            Culture and Identity
        </h1>
        <p>
            Culture is a very curious thing. It arises when people come together and interact for a
            long time, and their interactions become more and more strange the more they talk.
            Culture however, affects more than just how you talk to other people, it also deeply
            changes the way that you think about yourself. There are many ways that culture affects
            your identity, but first we must understand how culture is expressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many different ways that humans can show other humans what’s on their mind.
            For one, we can just talk. Talking is one of the most I have met people that spend quite
            a lot of time on social media, and they use vocabulary that reflects their online
            culture, like “lol” or "subscribe". Some people talk very fast and often because they
            are part of a culture that doesn't value silence. Another more subtle way to express
            culture is to create things, like art or literature, making music about our daily woes
            or how love is so hard. In the 14th century, the plague changed European culture
            significantly, and the culture changed the tone of the art; there were many more
            displays of misfortune and death triumphant in paintings. Castles were constructed not
            with war in mind, but infected or upset tenants.st and often because they are part of a
            culture that doesn't value silence. And these external events can affect culture, as
            seen in the previous example.

            Culture results from the way that prople interact with each other, sonit only makes
            sense that culture can also arise from how people interact with the world around them.
            The stuff that people think about is often related to their environment, because they
            need to pay attention to it to live. When major things happen, people change the way
            that they think, and thus the way that they express their culture. First nations culture
            was very nature oriented because they spent all of their time hunting, crafting clothes,
            or preparing food. They didn’t think about math or philosophy all that much because they
            didn’t need to, and so their culture addressed the things that they did do, and all the
            things that they would need to know. In places with a big oil industry like Alberta,
            people are much less supportive of climate action because it means that their way of
            life has to end. They spend their whole day possibly working in the industry, and they
            would all lose their jobs if the oil industry was shut down. People are more hostile
            because they were raised by oil workers who needed to be or else they wouldn’t get paid.
            The oil in Alberta fundamentally changes the way that people view other people. There
            are even weird things that happen when cultures interact with other cultures.
        </p>
        <p> Several things can happen when cultures meet. They can acknowledge or ignore each other,
            like most cultures, or they can assimilate into a larger culture, like what happens when
            two people from India and Canada have a child, and that child grows up with both an
            Indian and a Canadian culture. One of the cultures can try and destroy the other one,
            like in Germany where Jewish people were brought into work camps and then killed.
            Similarly, One can suppress the other, and try to put their own culture into the other
            people, which was the purpose of residential schools, to save the barbaric children by
            teaching them christianity and civility. This however can create a new culture, one of
            rebellion and Cultures sometimes change drastically after coming into contact with
            another culture.

            So what does this mean for me? From a young age, I was labeled as smart, and I wasn’t
            really being challenged at school. I was reading a lot of adult books, and I had quite a
            lot of knowledge from reading books like “homo sapiens” in grade four, so I naturally
            watched a lot of educational videos when I could be on youtube. I had a wide variety of
            educational content available to me, and I was watching it all. I was a part of this
            culture that valued truth and knowledge. I also had an academic dad, and the things that
            he liked talking about were either work or cool engineering concepts, so I picked the
            latter and he was feeding into my culture as well. Additionally, because I spent most of
            my time in school, I had a use and a need for lots of this knowledge, because we were
            learning it. At this point, I had been a nerd for over half my life and it has had a
            huge impact on the way that I think, the friends I make, and how I ask questions.

            We have seen that the plague can change the things people paint about, and how cultures
            can try and kill each other when they meet. Culture is intertwined with identity,
            through how people talk to you, to the kind of entertainment you like. There being oil
            where you live can result in you respecting other people less, or the way that people
            save time can give you a distinct feel to your speech. I am an analytical person because
            of the culture of education. Nevertheless, thanks for reading my essay.
