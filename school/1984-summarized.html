            Nineteen eighty-four is a very strange book. It was written in 1949 by Eric Arthur
            Blair, more commonly known as George Orwell, and it is a cross between a social science
            fiction and a dystopian alternate earth. The main character’s name is Winston Smith, who
            was born in the superstate Oceania in the city Airship One, which today would be known
            as london. Winston works in the Ministry of Truth “correcting errors'' in past records.
            He secretly hates the party, and knows that he will be tortured and killed because of
            it. He falls in love with a coworker, Julia, and after a lengthy affair, they decide to
            join a revolution against the party. They meet Mr. O’Brien, who sets them up in the
            revolution, but soon betrays them and both Winston and Julia end up in the ministry of
            truth, where they are tortured and presumably killed.

            The first thing that I liked about this book was that the concepts that were explored
            and the themes (total surveillance, nationalism censorship, and inequality, among
            others) were very appealing to me, so the parts where the author writes about the system
            of Ingsoc, or english socialism and how it functions in a book that Winston reads, and
            one of my favourite lines was: “A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a
            permanent war. This—although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a
            shallower sense—is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: War is Peace” (Poe, Part 2,
            Chapter 9). This moment in the book really clicked in my head the reasons why the party
            does what it does, to uphold a core value. That value isn’t a very good one, but the
            thing that makes the party tick finally makes sense. It really makes the story that much
            more plausible. The other thing that I really liked about the book that had to do with
            the world building was the final scene, where Winston is at the Chestnut Tree Cafe,
            where he says the very last line of the book, “He had won the victory over himself. He
            loved big brother” (Poe, Part 3, Chapter 6). This was another powerful moment for me
            because it made me very confused at first about whether this was a good ending or not.
            After thinking about it for a while, I decided that this was a good ending, which gave
            me a laugh because I had won the mini battle over myself, and loved big brother. Anyway.
            I liked how the author answered all of my questions about the system of the society.

            I didn’t love everything about this book however. I think that it could have had some
            more humor to add an ironic twist to the style. Speaking of the style, the way the story
            was written kept me captivated, yet it was quite draining to read, because the style is
            very melancholy and harshly real. This is a section of the book that was picked at
            random: “But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty’s figures, it
            was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for
            another” (Poe, Part 1, Chapter 4). Winston is reflecting on the reality of truth in the
            party, in a very detached way. He could have said something like “As he altered the
            figures in the day newspaper, he thought about how the figures that he was correcting
            were most likely wrong, and there was no shame in changing wrong numbers to equally
            wrong numbers”. This puts things in a more positive light. I do understand that this was
            to drive the message to the reader, but I found it a little hard to read at times. One
            ther complaint that I have was that most of the characters weren’t developed as much as
            I wanted them to. Winston and Julia have plenty of character development, but the other
            characters are much more flat compared to them.

            Overall, I would give this book a double thumbs up and I would recommend 1984 to anyone
            who enjoys reading unique perspectives, and I would not recommend it to anyone that
            doesn’t like sad stories.
