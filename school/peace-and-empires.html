            Have Empires Led to a More Peaceful World?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Empires are a great force of progress, driving humanity forwards ever on. They improve
            the lives of many people, and allow humans to cooperate in numbers unachievable
            otherwise. However, this cooperation has a disastrous downside; it causes frequent and
            devastating wars. It seems that just when humans are at their greatest, are they the
            most blood thirsty and hateful. In 10000 BCE, the majority of the population lived in
            small groups along the coast, spending their whole life in support of a small number of
            people, all of whom they knew deeply. When they made a decision, it was with every
            person in mind. This level of thoughtfulness and empathy meant that conflict was very
            rare, and when it did arise, it was often dealt with non-violently and amicably (Lomas
            2).
        </p>
        <p>
            After the advent of agriculture, the population exploded, and soon enough large villages
            became cities of thousands, and managing resources couldn’t be done by group consensus,
            like before. To handle decisions, leaders were appointed, which meant that the manpower
            of a city could be much easily coordinated, but it also meant the wisdom of the crowd
            was no longer accessible. Leaders had to be skeptical of anything that other parties
            did. The first commonly accepted empire in the Akkadian empire. At its height, it was
            ruled by one king, Sargon, and he used the resources of a large united population to try
            and conquer the known world (Salem Media, 2). During his 50 year reign, there were 34
            wars. Before that, there was no civilization coordinated or populated enough to make
            this possible.

            The other factor in war is amount of force that each party can muster. As the population
            increased, the severity of wars increased because instead of a village of 50 raiding
            another village, it was the Akkadian empires standing army of 5400 raiding the entire
            countryside (Salem Media). In the case of two nations warring, each side would have had
            this size of army, which would have had disastrous consequences for the population of
            each nation. In an increasingly hostile world, conflict was no more a quarrel between
            brothers, but a desperate fight to maintain the livelihood of every citizen in a
            kingdom.

            Wars continued to get more frequent and devastating, boosted occasionally by
            revolutionary discoveries such as gunpowder, or the steam engine. This culminated in the
            World Wars, when a relatively small conflict called on alliance after alliance until
            almost the entire world was involved (History.org). The military power of the entire
            world was being used by the empires of that time in a fight for survival, and it is
            estimated that this caused over 100 million deaths, both of civilians and soldiers
            (Britannica). Since then, the severity and amount of wars have gone down to record lows,
            in part because people do not want a repeat of the world wars, and in part because of
            the existential threat of nuclear weapons, which is so great that many countries have
            banned their use. Additionally, the fear that these weapons have caused has brought
            together countries to form the largest alliance in the world (world101).

            Historically, empires have made the population more susceptible to war, and in general,
            the larger the popuation in a group, the less peace that they will have. However,
            empires are the only way to achieve enormous levels of growth in a very short time, and
            we seem to be moving towards more peace in the future as world leaders form larger and
            larger alliances. Perhaps empires will be beneficial in the long term if not in the
            short term.
