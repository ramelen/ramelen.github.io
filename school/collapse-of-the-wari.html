            The Collapse of the Wari Empire
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Wari Empire formed around the 6th century in the Andes, and through an aptitude to
            expansion and a strong economy, became the first nation in South America to be centrally
            governed. They survived through a thirty year drought that brought down the earlier
            Moche and Nazca civilisations, and built an extensive road network to rule over their
            territory. They became so influential as to affect art and architecture styles of the
            incas. Six centuries later, the people of Wari had mostly disbanded into separate
            polities. The question still remains, How did the Wari empire collapse, and why?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wari had been the first to use a terraced farming system, which allowed them to
            utilise the hills as farmland, advanced canal systems allowed them to channel rain water
            to cities at the foot of the hill, and be very efficient with water use. This allowed
            the empire to both withstand drought and to introduce maize as a staple food alongside
            the already common tubers. With the excess workforce, Wari warriors would search for
            polities and conquer them, either by force or, often agreeing to let the rulers retain
            power in exchange for labour in the capital. They would bring canals and roads to many
            places, and the standard of living increased for many people that joined the Wari. At
            peak influence, much of the coastal and highland areas were part of the empire.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wari were special in how they used this power, because most of the affairs were
            handled in the capital city, which was the first occurrence of this happening in South
            American history. This was in part made possible by the widespread use of psychedelics,
            where lavish parties would be held with psychedelic beer, to relax the attendees and
            make them more likely to act in favour of the empire. The political control this allowed
            was a very powerful tool. This was the first time that a government was administered
            from just one place, and it allowed them to make more effective decisions and increase
            their power much faster than if each tribe had acted on its own. The Tiwanaku were like
            this, they were a group of polities that had shared a belief system and would fight for
            each other or lend help if needed. The government in Wari was stable for now, but under
            powerful stresses, it would not survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            At around 950 CE, a global climate change occurred called the Medieval Climatic Anomaly.
            For most of the Americas this meant centuries of higher temperatures and lower amounts
            of precipitation. There was a lot of strain on the agriculture in the Andes, as the
            efficient water canals couldn’t deal with prolonged drought. This is thought to be the
            cause of the collapse of the Tiwanaku, as they didn’t have the agricultural technology
            that The Wari did. Even they were barely making it by. It was here that the political
            control that the Wari had was stretched thin, and there was a social and governmental
            breakdown. This was the main cause of the Wari collapse. Indiscriminate and systematic
            violence broke out. Lizzie Wade writes: “Even in their heyday, the Wari were no
            strangers to violence … [b]ut as long as the empire was strong, the violence was
            ritualized and limited.” (Wade, p.5) She goes on to talk about the amount of people with
            both non-lethal and lethal head injuries, which skyrocket up to three times what they
            were at the peak of The Wari Empire.

            Overall, the reign of the Wari was a successful one, advancing technology and governance
            in South America, and paving the way for the Incan empire to form. It is also a good
            exercise in the fall of empires, how and why they happen. It is not perfect, because
            another category of stress on a nation are the external events, such as sudden
            innovation or military advance. The only problem is that studying history is that it is
            going to come with a lot of uncertainty, and sometimes outright missing information.
            South America didn't have any kind of writing system during the reign of the Wari, so
            anything that can only be learned from writing can't be deduced from ruins and skeletal
            remains. The names of important people or gods are lost to time, and the trade relations
            of the Wari with the Tiwanaku have not been proven, but given current evidence and
            reasoning, many people agree about the fate of the Wari. The current story in my mind is
            that an extended period of drought caused increased political tensions which eventually
            shattered the unstable government.
