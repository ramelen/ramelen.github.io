            Contrasting Opinions of the Importance of Animals
        </h1>
        <p>
            There are many opinions on the importance of animals. Two such opinions are detailed in
            a book, “Grey Eyes”, and an Atlantic article. They describe two very different
            situations, where one reverses animals and the other thinks of them as a means to a more
            important end. I will outline several differences between the excerpts within each
            paragraph.
        </p>

            In “Grey Eyes”, Blue Elk Man remarks about how sad he was when he killed his first large
            animal, an elk. He says: “I was thinking of my family when I made the kill, but I still
            felt guilty afterwards.” The only benefits of killing the buffalo were the physical
            resources it could provide, and there was a cultural hate towards killing in general.
            This made waste the worst of both worlds. He felt terrible after a minor death, and it
            clearly affects his decisions and his worldview.

            In the article by the Atlantic, the Phippen writes that “[t]he Army wasn't in the
            business of guiding hunting trips for soft skinned Wall Streeters, but it was in the
            business of controlling the Native Americans in the area, and that meant killing
            buffalo”. The killing of buffalo was only good, because the benefit of driving away the
            indiginous people was the only thing they saw, not the waste or possible endangerment of
            buffalo. Large amounts of killing didn’t affect the people at all, as it was masked by
            the benefits.

            After Blue Elk Man speaks, Painted Turtle Man speaks about the reason that they never
            waste any part of the animal: “We must always honour our brother animals. We need them
            for food and furs. That is why we make every effort to see that the entire animal finds
            a purpose and that nothing is ever wasted”. A lot of thought is put into the animals,
            because they have constructed a whole story around the animals because they care about
            them a lot. In the article, a colonel is thought to have said: “Kill every buffalo you
            can! Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone”. This suggests that the killing is just a
            means to an end, and that there is no immediate value to the killing of the buffalo. Not
            much thought is put into the buffalo, all of it has been put into the eradication of the
            indigenous people.

            Painted Turtle Man explains that “[w]hen one of our animal brothers presents itself to a
            hunter it is sacrificing itself for the good of the Nehiyawak”. Each animal has a
            purpose and an individual. They have a lot of importance assigned to them, because if
            they were not there, the people would not survive. This is a relationship where the
            people are very conservative when it comes to the animals, and the animals are plentiful
            and easy to get.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the article a person killed 30 buffalo in one hunting trip and had not assigned any
            importance to the animals, and the buffalo had been abstracted into another form,
            driving away the indiginous people. The buffalo had no individuality and were just a
            number in the mind of a hunter. It wasn’t about the buffalo, so the value was thrown
            away in turn for political victory.
