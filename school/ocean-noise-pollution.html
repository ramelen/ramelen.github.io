            Consequences of Science Pertaining to Ocean Noise Pollution
        </h1>
        <p>
            When you think of the ocean, you may imagine serene waters, filled with life, free from
            the dangers of hurricanes and forest fires. This is not the case. Sound, which travels
            extremely far in water and is the primary sense of almost all marine life, is being
            emitted by humans in enormous quantities. This is causing confusion and death almost
            everywhere in the oceans. Why is it here, and what can we do about it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sound in the oceans before the industrial revolution consisted of two things (Conlon).
            The first is biophony; animal communication like whale calls and dolphin chirps. This is
            a vital part of these species' lives, used for everything from mating to coordination.
            The second is geophony; storms, hydrothermal vents, cracking ice, earthquakes, and gas
            bubbles. This makes the background sound level in the ocean about 100dB.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of this, ships all over the world create large amounts of noise if their engines
            are touching the hull, or if the propeller makes low pressure zones as it spins,
            generating a constant hum that we cant hear, but that results in a constant rumble in a
            large area around the boat. Rumbling can also be caused by drills in oil rigs, or by low
            flying airplanes (Beane). Military sonar technology emits startlingly loud bursts
            regularly, so these bursts can be heard by sensors on the other side of the earth. All
            this can raise the sound level to almost 200dB.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is of course hurting the very sensitive ears of marine life, who’s ears have been
            tuned to take advantage of the range of sound. Near constant noise can deafen and
            confuse whales, as well as taking away time for them to talk to each other. This is also
            known to cause masking, where an animal loses the ability to detect sounds of interest,
            like mating calls or prey sounds. The noise interferes with essential processes, which
            has led to huge numbers of deaths and even mass beachings (Marsh) after military tests
            of sonar equipment (Marsh). Sudden noises, like those from air guns used to find oil,
            can cause hemorrhaging and decompression sickness as the animal swims up and away from
            the sound too fast source?.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sustained elevated sounds seem to cause lower biodiversity (Weilgart), and lower fishing
            yields due to fish avoiding the area altogether. Noise around whales may compound on
            other issues, leading to more occurrences with net entanglement and ship strikes, and
            destroying already polluted sources of food. Several technologies have been developed to
            solve this issue. Propellers can easily be redesigned to produce less noise by reducing
            the low pressure areas under a blade which create bubbles (Beane). Adding sound
            insulation into ships is another way to reduce the amount of noise emitted. Another
            technology is called Vibroseis (Marsh), which is orders of magnitude quieter than
            current oil survey methods. Restrictions have been put in place to restrict the amount
            of noise in some areas, and it has been shown that whales are less stressed when there
            are less ships in an area, like after 9/11 and during the beginning of Covid-19
            (Schiffman).
        </p>

            These solutions seem like plenty enough to reverse this process, and the nice thing
            about noise is that as soon as you stop making it, it goes away. This is good because we
            have more important issues, so we can afford to solve this issue more slowly. On the
            other hand, if this goes on for too long, there might be irreversible damage to
            biodiversity or the ecosystem.
