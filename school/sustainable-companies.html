            How can companies be incentivised to become sustainable?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Interface Inc. is one of the largest carpet manufacturing companies in the world, and in
            1994, it realized the huge environmental impact that it had on the climate. It now
            operates net carbon-neutral and is executing plans to become carbon negative. How and
            why did it do this so long before many other businesses started to take action against
            climate change? This essay will look at the history of Interface and how other companies
            can follow in their footsteps.

            In 1973, Ray Anderson quit his job as a researcher at Milliken and Co., a textile firm,
            to start his own business as a carpet manufacturer. He called it Carpets International
            of Georgia (CI-Georgia) as a joint venture with Carpets International PLC (CI) and
            seeded with 1.5 million dollars from himself and people from his town. In its first year
            of operation, it flopped, losing 400,000 dollars with just over 800,000 of sales. This
            was largely due to the skyrocketing prices of petrochemicals, a vital material used in
            carpets. Fortunately, CI-Georgia’s connections with CI gave it access to credibility and
            technology, and so it turned its first profit just two years later. Eventually, it
            entered fierce competition with other carpet companies, and had to be partially
            purchased by CI, who renamed it to Interface Flooring Systems Inc. Soon enough Interface
            had passed the market share of Anderson's previous employers, Milliken and Co (Company
            Histories.com). This is a common pattern of growth for a company like Interface. Almost
            all the effort is put into growth and development of the company, and very little on its
            impact on the climate. It is very hard for the government to solve this, because the
            thing that is stopping the company from becoming more sustainable is resources, and that
            can’t just be given away by the government. It is analogous when a low-income person is
            saving to buy a car so that they can commute across the city to get a better job. You
            can’t ask that person to double the amount that they pay for their car so that they can
            convert to electric. The electric car will save them money in the long run and will help
            save the climate, but they can’t afford it. They first have to buy a cheap gas guzzling
            van so that they can make the money to get an electric car later. The best thing that
            governments can do is to make electric cars cheaper than gas cars by investing or
            subsidizing electric car innovation.

            Fast-forward to 1994, Interface is now a global player in the carpet industry, with
            hundreds of millions in sales, and is being faced with a new question: "What is your
            company doing for the environment?”. Like virtually every company at the time, this was
            something that its CEO had never given thought to before, and it was very awkward for
            the whole company (Interface, YouTube). A part of his research division wanted to create
            a team to quantify the exact effect that Interface had on the climate. They called on
            Anderson to launch this force with a speech to share his great climate vision, but he
            famously replied, “do we have one?”. His head of human resources, Joyce LeValle, handed
            him a copy of “The Ecology of Commerce” by Paul Hawken, and it completely changed how he
            thought about his business. The thesis of the book is that large corporations like
            Interface are the main force that degrades the earth’s climate, and also that they are
            the party best equipped with the tools to reverse it (Anderson, YouTube). This resonated
            with Anderson, and it made him realize that protecting the climate is in the best
            interests of his business. He realized that he needed an electric car. This is the stage
            when government action is best used, because it is between when a company is too
            powerful to affect and when it can’t afford to make changes like this. The most powerful
            thing that a party can do here is to convince the people making the decisions that
            sustainability is the best course of action. Anderson was convinced at the perfect time
            as he looked for ways to expand his business and sought to answer the question of
            sustainability. Governments can help by raising awareness that companies are a critical
            part of the journey to sustainability, and again, need to incentivize sustainable
            development by investing in making it cheaper.

            At the end of their inquiry, the task force found that Interface had produced over 500
            million kilograms of raw materials in mostly petrochemical waste over their lifetime of
            20 years. They estimated carbon emissions to be over 2.6 billion kilograms per year, or
            over 21.8 kilograms per square meter of carpet. (Interface Sustainability Report) Once
            Anderson realized the true impact of Interface, he announced Mission Zero, a pledge to
            reach net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2020. They started by looking at the
            materials in their carpets. The yarn and backing are made from nylon, which is
            manufactured using petroleum. They bought as much of their nylon from recycled sources
            as possible, and set up their own program to recycle the carpets that they had
            previously sold to people. For some materials like the limestone used to bind together
            carpet fibers, they buy it off of the construction industry as a waste product and
            process it into their carpets (MacArthur Foundation, YouTube). This not only reduces
            waste in Interface, but other industries as well. As well as producing less waste, the
            recycled products are much closer to manufacturing sites, so there are less carbon
            emissions from shipping. The result of all this is that 42% percent of all materials
            that go through manufacturing sites are from recycled sources, and there is 92% less
            waste entering landfills from their product. A surprising benefit to this is that since
            1994, Interface has saved over 430 million dollars in waste handling (MacArthur).
            Another aspect of reducing the impact on the environment in carbon emissions. Carbon
            emissions are split up into 3 scopes across the supply chain; Scope 1, which is direct
            emissions from the manufacturing itself; Scope 2, which is indirect emissions through
            things like purchased energy; and Scope 3, which is indirect emissions not in the
            control of the company, like the use of the product after sale or the transportation
            emissions of its suppliers (Interface EPDs). Interface has worked to reduce these
            numbers in a variety of ways. Scope 1 emissions have been reduced significantly by using
            machines in the manufacturing process that produce fewer emissions. Scope 2 emissions
            are almost zero as renewable energy makes up 89% of energy consumption at factories.
            Scope 3, which makes up about 95% of total emissions, is the hardest to reduce because
            Interface is often not in control of it. The best way to remove these emissions is to
            not use their service in the first place. Recycling programs have shifted nylon
            production emissions into much lower emissions from the recycling process. Business
            travel emissions have been reduced by holding investor meetings and research endeavors
            online, shipping emissions reduced by having factories spread out over many continents.
            All this has led to a total reduction of emissions of 82% since 1994. In 2021. Interface
            emitted 481 million kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gasses, or 4.1
            kilograms per square meter of carpet (Interface Sustainability Report). The rest of the
            emissions are covered by investing in carbon negative processes, or carbon offsets, like
            reforestation or carbon sequestration, making Interface a net zero company. This is the
            stage where governments can actually support the company themselves to help other
            companies reach this point. This is what all companies need to be to live sustainably
            and with no impact on the environment.
        </p>

            Interface is a great example of the journey that businesses should go through on their
            path to sustainability, from initial growth to adoption of sustainable techniques, to
            innovation in the field and advancing the technology for the entire industry. Careful
            management of a global supply chain can lead to huge cost saving, and government action
            that doesn't need to control every location of a factory, but just the decision making
            part of the company. They can incentivize the right behavior at every stage and make
            radical change happen in time to reverse drastic climate change.
