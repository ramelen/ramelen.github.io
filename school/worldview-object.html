            I have a lot of projects. Sometimes they go somewhere, and sometimes they don’t. Usually
            they don’t. And I often find myself trying to figure out which ones have the highest
            chance of going somewhere. Usually my project ideas have two dimensions when I
            categorize them; Coolness, and Difficulty. Coolness is defined by how much I want to
            work on the project and how useful it would be if I finished it. Very cool things are
            basically guaranteed to make it on my list of possible future projects, and less cool
            things I quickly forget about. Difficulty is about how much time and effort I would need
            to put into the project in order to complete it, with hard projects having a lower
            chance of succeeding. Then if the coolness and difficulty are within certain bounds, I
            try the project. After I’ve completed the project, the coolness transforms into pride.
            This pride is what my object centers around. What type of project generates the most
            pride in my worldview?
        </p>
        <p>
            You could represent my pride as being roughly proportional to the product of the
            coolness and the difficulty of the project. That is to say, they compound each other.
            Projects which are very hard and not very cool, like say, school, have an amount of
            pride, though much less pride than the difficulty justifies. Conversely, something very
            cool that I whack out in an hour, say, a custom app color theme (I’m such a nerd) I
            often end up taking for granted and it doesn’t generate a lot of pride. The most
            prideful project is one that is very difficult, and also very cool. So some candidates
            for hard projects might be; Starting a business; Running a marathon; Writing a book;
            Getting a masters degree; etc. Things that require hundreds or thousands of hours of
            time, thousands of dollars, and a fair amount of skill. Things that I find cool usually
            are; Intellectually complex and stimulating; Very elegant at their core; and able to be
            used in a large number of ways. This is why I like math and programming so much. They
            are the most complex and practical yet elegant systems you could possibly imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which brings me to the ideal project. What is difficult, respected, elegant,
            intellectually complex, and useful? Why, that’s a book! Books are a culmination of
            thousands of an author's thoughts, carefully constructed into an object of knowledge.
            They’ve been around for millennia and have served a myriad of purposes, always adapting
            to their own specific needs and uses. For me, books are the perfect project, a beautiful
            balance of complexity and difficulty.

            The whole reason I think about this is because it is deeply connected with my
            relationship with knowledge. I view knowledge as a great thing in and of itself, and so
            much of my life is built around that fact. I spend a lot of my free time learning, with
            what’s left going towards creating knowledge and experiences to put out into the world.
            Most of my not free time is spent at school, developing skills and learning even more. I
            have no interest in being an athlete, nor becoming an actor, but I consider any
            afternoon spent in front of a blackboard as a day well spent. This is my relationship
            with knowledge, as it is shapes, and is shaped by, my worldview.
