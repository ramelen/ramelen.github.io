            Useless Language (and the Importance of Planning)

            <i>I sighed. Nobody is ever going to learn tchiqagnwuan, are they?</i> It had been a few
            weeks since I finished my homemade sign language, but people weren’t as excited to learn
            it as I thought. I looked at the sticky note on my wall proclaiming that tchiqagnwuan
            (sheh-can-wahn) was finished. It screamed naive joy at me. What could I do to revive my
            project? <i>Maybe I could make an instructional website?</i> I knew that was too much
            work, but I jotted it down on my lengthy list of possible projects anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came up with the idea for tchiqagnwuan early in the school year, as a means to
            exchange jokes and talk in total secrecy. The idea was that instead of alerting grumpy
            teachers using noisy spoken language, we could simply wiggle our fingers and presto,
            snarky comment delivered. I thought it was a genius idea, and imagined my friends and I
            exchanging jokes during a dry assembly. Soon enough I gathered my friends under a small
            gathering of trees in the school yard. The air reeked of mischief, and I had high hopes.
            However, while I got to begin crafting the language together with blistering speed, my
            hastiness would be my downfall.
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew that you could design a language relatively easily because it had been done many
            times before. It often happens in circumstances where two peoples meet and they don’t
            share a common language. They sometimes form a small language called a pidgin, although
            it isn’t usually signed. In homes where deaf children are cut off from regular sign
            language education the children sometimes create their own signed language to speak to
            their family. Languages don’t have to be large either. My favourite constructed
            language, toki pona, famously only has 120-ish words, and it has hundreds if not
            thousands of speakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew that if I designed the whole language myself, it wouldn’t engage my friends long
            enough to learn anything. The plan was to have my friends come up with some words and
            grammar to have a piece of the language to call their own. So I asked my friend group of
            exclusively teenage boys to come up with words for a language that couldn't be
            understood by anybody else. You can guess how that went. Let’s just say that teaching
            this language to adults would present some rather embarrassing challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn’t long before we could construct entire conversations. We regularly asked each
            other what we were doing after school, or where someone was, and we got pretty far until
            we ran out of vocabulary. It seemed fine though; we would simply invent a new word and
            carry on. After just a few weeks there were over 30 words at our disposal. That doesn’t
            seem like much, but 30 words can go a long way. English by a certain definition has over
            1.4 million words, but many of these are different forms of the same word such as ‘car’
            and ‘cars’, or synonyms like ‘beautiful’ and ‘pretty’. That’s how toki pona gets away
            with only 120 words; each word has a much broader meaning. The word ‘lipu’ in one
            context can mean ‘book’, or ‘books’, or ‘paper’, or even ‘slab’. It’s up to the reader
            to extract the meaning from context.
        </p>

            This was all well and good, but eventually the cracks in our plan started showing. The
            language was growing so fast that we couldn't distribute all the new changes fast enough
            for people to learn. My friends started falling behind and soon enough only my best
            friend and I knew enough to communicate. I tried to teach more to my friends, but they
            quickly lost interest and it never got off the ground. I remember finding a spare moment
            in gym class and pulling a friend to the side and teaching them some words. I could see
            their eyes glaze over as I contemplated teaching them yet another word. When I tried to
            strike up a conversation with them later they merely shrugged and walked away. The
            problem, I think, was in motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to self-determination theory, there are two types of motivation; intrinsic
            motivation, which is when you want to do something just for the fun of it; and extrinsic
            motivation, when you do something for a reward or to avoid a punishment. Most people are
            intrinsically motivated to play video games, and most people are extrinsically motivated
            to wear nice clothes. Intrinsic motivation is the most potent form of motivation and
            it’s what drives hobbies and successful businesses. It easily trumps extrinsic
            motivation in priority, perhaps unless the motivation is that you’re being chased by a
            bear. See, my best friend and I had intrinsic motivation, and we could keep going for as
            long as we wanted. My other friends however, were extrinsically motivated by my attempts
            to sell this idea to them. I couldn’t do much to give them intrinsic motivation, and I
            couldn’t give them good enough extrinsic motivation to overcome the learning barrier.

            The problem is that there were underlying problems. Tchiqagnwuan isn't useful in the
            areas it was supposed to be. During presentations, everybody is paying too much
            attention to be looking at friends waiting for comments. The problem could be solved
            easily by sitting next to one another and using the nearly perfected art of whispering.
            Often I would sit in the audience of an assembly and look around for my friends, only to
            find myself unable to get their attention and realizing it was leagues easier to simply
            speak.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had worked on this for months, and the sunk cost fallacy got me. I took all of spring
            break to redesign tchiqagnwuan to improve the grammar and write up a complete list of
            about 100 words. I spent many hours in front of a whiteboard, testing out sentences and
            making up signs. It gave my hope that I could actually pull it off. I couldn’t. The
            language was just as hard to learn as before and while it was slightly more versatile,
            it still wasn’t good enough to use in day to day life. Even worse, I had changed it so
            much that I couldn’t even talk to my best friend anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I had taken a few weeks after coming up with the idea to really think through the
            advantages and disadvantages before presenting the idea, I perhaps could have fixed the
            obvious problems and made something that was actually useful. I could have made a spoken
            language that was designed to be very audible at the lowest whisper, or a multiple
            finger morse code that could transmit twice as much information. Thankfully, I’ve gotten
            a lot better at this and now do a fair amount of planning for all my projects, but those
            projects have reduced the amount of time I have to work on tchiqagnwuan. I may still
            keep it around and write up a guide to keep for a while, but for now, it seems to be a
            useless language.
