            Therapeutic Cloning: Is it worth the trouble?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Therapeutic cloning shows great promise in the field of medicine, but many issues need
            to be resolved before it can become a widespread treatment such as increasing success
            rates, decreasing cancer risk, and finding an ethical supply of IVF egg cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therapeutic cloning is the process of replacing the nucleus of a fertilized egg cell
            (usually a leftover from in vitro fertilization) with the nucleus of an autopsied cell
            (usually a skin cell) in order to harvest the cells at a certain stage in development to
            transplant back into a patient (Marks). This results in a collection of undifferentiated
            embryonic stem cells that can be used to regenerate organs or tissues like the spinal
            cord (Guang Zhao) or osteoblasts, which can reverse paralysis and osteoporosis
            respectively - was this from Guang Zhao too?.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the benefits of therapeutic cloning is that the DNA is supplied from the
            patient's own body, so it will not be rejected by the immune system after surgery. This
            means that no immunosuppressive drugs need to be used, as they come with a long list of
            side effects and are quite expensive. Another benefit is that the patient doesn't have
            to wait months or years for an organ donor because egg cells are easier to obtain and
            the DNA comes from the patient. In combination with gene editing, this technology can
            also be used to fix some genetic illnesses, as the gene in question can be edited to
            function as normal with CRISPR technology (Coleman).
        </p>
        <p>
            The main problem with therapeutic cloning is that a fertilized egg cell is used in the
            process, destroying any potential life that may have come from it. Solutions have been
            proposed that can generate stem cells without destroying the host embryo, thus
            eliminating the ethical conundrum, however the survival chance for the embryo is still
            slim afterwards (“Reprogramming somatic cells into stem cells”). Another problem with
            therapeutic cloning is that telomere length is inherited from the DNA donor, meaning
            that therapeutic cloning can be used to fix old age related issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, it seems that while therapeutic cloning has a very long way to go before
            becoming viable as a treatment, and there is a significant ethical argument with its own
            legal issues to be sorted out, its potential to cure many diseases and overcome problems
            with organ donation makes it a worthwhile technology to pursue.
