            Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Eric Yoon, but online I like to go by Ramelen.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <a href="/about.html">read more about me</a>, or if you want to look at the
            things I've done I've conveniently placed them here for you to read. I don't have any
            social media, but you can reach me by email at ramelen@proton.me.
        </p>

        <h3>Things!!</h3>

        <div class="twosplit">
            <p>
                <b><a>Tchiqagnwuan (Dead Link)</a></b><br>
                A teeny sign language that I designed with my friends as a joke for secret
                communication. It was horribly flawed on so many levels, but I had a good time. If I
                get around to it there might be some documentation/lessons and a dictionary here.
                Sequel coming soon?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><a>PFIM (Dead Link)</a></b><br>
                A great big puzzle I designed for my friends, with the body being a 10,000 word
                collection of journal entries hidden in physical places.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="twosplit">
            <p>
                <b><a href="/palette.html">OKHSV Color Palette</a></b><br>
                A set of colors made by evenly sampling the Okhsv color space to create groups that
                have the same percieved lightness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><a href="/school.html">School</a></b><br>
                A collection of essays (and other things) I wrote during high school in the IB
                program. It totals about 12,000 words over 3 years.

        <h3>Other People's Things!</h3>

        <div class="twosplit">
            <p>
                <b><a href="https://yield-return-null.itch.io/lazer-curling">Lazer
                        Curling</a></b><br>
                An arcade co op game my friend made where you and a friend play as out of control
                curling pucks that shoot each other with lazers. He did all of the real work, but I
                helped with a lot of the design and play testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><a href="https://yield-return-null.itch.io/aspen">Aspen</a></b><br>
                The first game my friend and I worked on. We don't talk about this one.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="twosplit">
            <p>
                <b><a></a></b><br>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b><a href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona</a></b><br>
                A minimalist yet fully functional constructed language with a mere 120 words. I
                don't even know the creator, I just really like the language.
